<time>mon, dec 22</time>
<p><i>i've tried a lot of ways of keeping track of my TODO's and so far only one has even sort of worked</i></p>
<p>first, here's some approaches that didn't work for me<br>
a) scattering the TODO's throughout the code -- they accumulate and become meaningless and overwhelming; plus they distract from explanatory comments<br>
b) curating the TODO's in GitHub issues -- way too much friction; requires me to be connected to the internet; end up piling up and becoming meaningless<br>
c) no TODO list (follow your heart 🥺) -- unfortunately, my heart is a dumb dumb (boring ideas never gets done, fun/stupid ideas always get started but rarely get finished)<br>
</p>
<p>
and here's an approach that did work for me<br>
- i have one file called <code>todo.x</code> and another file called <code>done.x</code><br>
- if i have an idea for something to do, i add it to <code>todo.x</code>, for example...
<pre>// TODO make a less exciting test_eso that doesn't require transforms, etc. (just draw the primitives yo)</pre>
- if i end up doing it, i replace <code>TODO</code> with <code>DONE</code> and move it to <code>done.x</code><br>
- if i end up realizing it was NOT worth doing, i replace <code>TODO</code> with <code>SKIP</code> and move it to <code>done.x</code>
</p>
<p><center>that's pretty much it 🤷</center></p>
<p>in practice, there are some additional details<br>
- i group the TODO's by app version, and try to only work on ones for the current version<br>
- within a version, i group the TODO's by feature or whatever<br>
- the first and most import important feature is <code><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/paying-down-your-technical-debt/">TechnicalDebt</a></code> -- this is where bugs, missing pieces of features, proposals to rename variables and functions, etc. go</p>

<time>sat, dec 20</time>
<p><i>writing stuff from scratch is delightfully infective</i></p>
<p>i started using <a href="https://x.com/vkrajacic/status/1730891609191981305">Vjekoslav Krajačić-style sliceable strings</a> a while back</p>
<pre>
STRUCT {
 U8 *_; // NOTE i usually name this kind of thing `_`; you could also use `data` or `v` or whatever
 U64 length;
} String;</pre>
<p>they're great. you can slice in O(1) and you don't need to null-terminate them</p>
<pre>// NOTE analogous to Python's string[start:one_past_end]
String _string_slice(String string, U32 start, U32 one_past_end) {
 // NOTE we allow empty slices
 ASSERT(start <= string.length);
 ASSERT(start <= one_past_end);
 ASSERT(one_past_end <= string.length);

 String result;
 result._ = &string._[start];
 result.length = (one_past_end - start);
 return(result);
}

// NOTE analogous to Python's string[start:]
String string_slice(String string, U32 start) {
 return _string_slice(string, start, string.length);
}</pre>
<p>the only downside i experienced using these String's was that the standard <code>printf</code> didn't know about them -- if you pass a non-null terminated one of these String's with <code>%s</code>, <code>printf</code> will just goes marching merrily off into the distance, looking for a 0 that may never come</p>
<p>i saw two ways around this (like always, there are probably more options than just these):<br>
A) remember to add null-terminators whenever i wanted to print of sprint, or<br>
B) bring your own printf</p>
<p>conventional wisdom has that option (B) is Bad and Hard, but conventional wisdom is basically always wrong, so let's go with option (B)</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/rfleury/status/1902138409365467439">like many Hard things</a>, it ended up taking about 5 minutes:<br>
1) borrow <a href="https://github.com/mpaland/printf">Marco Paland's tiny printf from GitHub</a>, and<br>
2) add ~20 mostly copy-and-pasted lines to it<p>
<pre>case 'S' : { // our custom String struct
 String string = va_arg(va, String);
 const char *p = string._;
 unsigned int l = (unsigned int) string.length;
 if (l) {
  // NOTE this block copy and pasted from case 's'
  ...
 }
}</pre>
<p>that's it.</p>
<p>and now we can do stuff like this...</p>
<pre>printf("[gui_tracked_box] box->key_string clash: %S\n", box->key_string);</pre>
<p>and since <code>snprintf</code> and <code>vsnprintf</code> also know about our String's now, we can use <code>%S</code> format specifiers in other functions, like...</p>
<pre>GUIBox *box_field_buffer = gui_tracked_box(
 "buffer_%S%S%S",
 string_prefix,
 command->string,
 field->name
);</pre>
<p><center>:D</center></p>
<p>sidenote: while i was in the neighborhood, i made a small change to <code>_internal_vsnprintf(...)</code> -- i prefer my functions to just crash the program when they fail, rather than returning some number i'll forget to check for and then spend hours trying to debug the downstream effects of</p>
<pre>int _internal_vsnprintf(...) {
 ...

 // // NOTE (copied from the printf docs)                                                                        
 // \return The number of characters that COULD have been written into the buffer, not counting the terminating  
 //         null character. A value equal or larger than count indicates truncation. Only when the returned value
 //         is non-negative and less than count, the result has been completely written.                         

 B32 success = (1
  && (result >= 0)
  && ((size_t) result < maxlen)
 );
 if (!success) {
  *((volatile S32 *) 0) = 0; // (crash)
